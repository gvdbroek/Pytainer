# Pytainer
A self-hostable web service that creates docker images of simple user provided scripts. So that anybody can write a simple python black box and share it within their company or team.
## Learning vs Future-Proofing
Here's a friendly reminder, just focus on learning, not on building a hyper-scalable app.
If it works, it works.

## Todo
### API
- [ ] Run containers on specific ports
  - [ ] Define a useable portrange for host-machine (don't worry too much about scaling, this is about learning)
- [ ] Redirect traffic into containers  
  - [ ] How?


### Front-End
- [ ] Api Web Interface
- [ ] Container Web Interface
